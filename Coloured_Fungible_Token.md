# Coloured Fungible Token

In food supply tracking, if we have a bag of sugar from factory A, and
another bag from factory B, it's still sugar in both bags. For the
purpose of tracking, we keep distinguishing them up to a certain
point. If we mix them for bakery, the resulting mixture loses this
tracking property. If the sugar is used up for baking, it's not sugar
any more.

So, the idea is to add _colour_ to a fungible token: a number of
attributes that are preserved in transfers, and merged or destroyed
when tokens of different colours are mixed together.
