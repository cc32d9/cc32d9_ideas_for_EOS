# Digital nation concept

A free society of anonymous people. Each person is, with high
probablility, only linked to one account.

Accounts are residing in several EOS networks, such as EOS Mainnet,
TELOS, WORBLI, etc.

Public KYC services, such as WORBLI, provide a flag associated with user
accounts indicating that the user has passed KYC. Based on this
information, accounts in other EOS networks can be reliably associated
with WORBLI accounts.

Also other public KYC services could be integrated.

We do not want any of user identity, we just try to limit users to one
account per person.

Use cases:

* Opinion polling

* Self-governed societies

* Digital citizenship, like in those micronations
  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_micronations)

* Local societies. The users can deliberately disclose their country or
  city of residence, and form local interest groups

* Reputation-based electronic commerce

* Public influence groups; legal initiatives
